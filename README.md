# Time Management App

This is a hobby application. I started it to practice building single page applications.

[Demo: time-manager.kalina.tech](http://time-manager.kalina.tech/)

Demo users:
- Regular user
  - email: manager@manager.com
  - password: 123123
- Manager user
  - email: employee@employee.com
  - password: 123123
- Admin user
  - email: test@test.com
  - password: 123123

The server restores the DB automatically every morning.
